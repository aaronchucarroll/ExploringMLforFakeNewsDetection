# Exploring Natural Language Processing for Fake News

A project I did in high school as part of a 3 year Science Research course, beginning in January of 2018 until March of 2021. I tested the ability of a public access Deep Learning model called Grover in detecting fake news. I used a fake news dataset comprised of ~6000 annotated instances of real and fake news, sourced from various political sources and fake news websites. Grover was then retrained with this dataset, and tested on its accuracy. Attached in this repo are the initial project proposal, as well as the final project.
