# Exploring Machine Learning for Fake News Detection

This repo contains a project I did in high school as part of a 3 year Science Research course, beginning in September 2018 until March 2021. I tested the ability of an open source Deep Learning model called [Grover](https://grover.allenai.org/) in detecting fake news. Grover's neural model was trained on computer generated fake news, and I wondered how it would perform on human written news that was spreading on social media. I used a fake news dataset comprised of ~6000 annotated instances of real and fake news, sourced from various political outlets and fake news websites. I then retrained Grover with this dataset, and tested its accuracy. The retrained Grover model performed far better at identifying real instances of fake news than the original model.
