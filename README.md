# Exploring Machine Learning for Fake News Detection

A project I did in high school as part of a 3 year Science Research course, beginning in September 2018 until March 2021. I tested the ability of an open source Deep Learning model called Grover in detecting fake news. Grover's neural model was trained on computer generated fake news, and I wondered how it would perform with human written news that was spreading on social media. I used a fake news dataset comprised of ~6000 annotated instances of real and fake news, sourced from various political outlets and fake news websites. Grover was then retrained with this dataset, and tested on its accuracy. Grover performed far better with the human data than with the neural data.
